<h4 style="text-align: center;">PARTICIPANT WAIVER, RELEASE OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNIFICATION </h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In consideration of Carolina Outfitters, Inc. furnishing services and/or equipment to participate
  in the activities or events I understand, acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.) THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INHERENT RISKS, DANGERS, AND HAZARDS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH MY
    PARTICIPATION IN WHITEWATER RAFTING ACTIVITIES</b>, both known and unknown, including, but not limited to
  drowning, hypothermia, fractures, partial or complete paralysis, injuries from being thrown from the boat, being
  struck by branches or overhanging tree limbs, river obstructions, foot entrapment in rocks in the river bed,
  paddle blows, bee stings, or animal bites, and disease, any of which could cause serious disability or death.
  The risks and dangers may be caused by the negligence of the owners, guides, employees, officers or agents of
  Carolina Outfitters, Inc, the United States of America, or the U.S. Forest Service; the negligence of the
  participants, negligence of others, accidents, forces of nature, or other causes. The risks and dangers may
  arise from guide or personnel decision-making, including, but not limited to that a guide or other personnel may
  misjudge terrain, weather, river conditions, water levels, and river navigation routes, as well as other risks,
  hazards, and dangers, both known and unknown, that are inherent to the recreational activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.) I KNOWINGLY AND FREELY ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS AND DANGERS, AND HAZARDS, both known and
    unknown, AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSSES AND/OR DAMAGES EVEN IF THEY ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM
    THE NEGLIGENCE OF CAROLINA OUTFITTERS, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE and/or
    by any other person, and I ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY PARTICIPATION. </b></p>

  properly fastened, and closely fitted at all times on or near the river, I will inspect all rafting equipment
  and I will use only equipment in good condition during and for this expedition, and if I observe any significant
  hazard during my participation, I will remove myself from participation, and report it to the mangers as quickly
  as possible. I will accept full financial responsibility for any damage to, or loss of rafting equipment while
  it is in my possession or control. I understand that whitewater rafting is a very strenuous physical, emotional,
  and mental activity and that I am in adequate physical and mental condition and that I have no limitations to my
  participation in the sport. I agree that I will be traveling on my own on the river without the support or
  supervision of Carolina Outfitters, and agree that this endeavor is not a joint venture but that it is and shall
  be considered an individual participation in the sport, and that there are no lifeguards on the river. I grant

  to be assessed automatically against me in the event that I or my respective heirs, assigns, personal agents or
  beneficiaries institute or attempt to seek legal recourse against any party, person, or entity unto which this
  document is given. I agree that the venue for any dispute that may arise out of this agreement to which Carolina
  Outfitters, Inc. or its agents is a party shall be in Bryson City, N.C. </p>

  ruled against by a member of a legal court, all the others items will remain effective. </p>
