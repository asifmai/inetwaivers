        <p class="para">In consideration of Carolina Outfitters, Inc. furnishing services and/or equipment to participate
          in the activities or events I understand, acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <p class="para"><b>1.) THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INHERENT RISKS, DANGERS, AND HAZARDS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH MY
            PARTICIPATION IN WHITEWATER RAFTING ACTIVITIES</b>, both known and unknown, including, but not limited to
          drowning, hypothermia, fractures, partial or complete paralysis, injuries from being thrown from the boat, being
          struck by branches or overhanging tree limbs, river obstructions, foot entrapment in rocks in the river bed,
          paddle blows, bee stings, or animal bites, and disease, any of which could cause serious disability or death.
          The risks and dangers may be caused by the negligence of the owners, guides, employees, officers or agents of
          Carolina Outfitters, Inc, the United States of America, or the U.S. Forest Service; the negligence of the
          participants, negligence of others, accidents, forces of nature, or other causes. The risks and dangers may
          arise from guide or personnel decision-making, including, but not limited to that a guide or other personnel may
          misjudge terrain, weather, river conditions, water levels, and river navigation routes, as well as other risks,
          hazards, and dangers, both known and unknown, that are inherent to the recreational activities.</p>
        <p class="para"><b>2.) I KNOWINGLY AND FREELY ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS AND DANGERS, AND HAZARDS, both known and
            unknown, AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSSES AND/OR DAMAGES EVEN IF THEY ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM
            THE NEGLIGENCE OF CAROLINA OUTFITTERS, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE and/or
            by any other person, and I ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY PARTICIPATION. </b></p>
        <p class="para">3.) I willingly agree to comply with terms and conditions for participation. I certify that any
          child participating weighs at least 60 pounds, or is at least 7 years of age; I am not, and will not be under
          the influence of drugs or alcohol on the premises or during my participation; I will wear my life jacket
          properly fastened, and closely fitted at all times on or near the river, I will inspect all rafting equipment
          and I will use only equipment in good condition during and for this expedition, and if I observe any significant
          hazard during my participation, I will remove myself from participation, and report it to the mangers as quickly
          as possible. I will accept full financial responsibility for any damage to, or loss of rafting equipment while
          it is in my possession or control. I understand that whitewater rafting is a very strenuous physical, emotional,
          and mental activity and that I am in adequate physical and mental condition and that I have no limitations to my
          participation in the sport. I agree that I will be traveling on my own on the river without the support or
          supervision of Carolina Outfitters, and agree that this endeavor is not a joint venture but that it is and shall
          be considered an individual participation in the sport, and that there are no lifeguards on the river. I grant
          Carolina Outfitters, Inc. permission to use my photographs.</p>
        <p class="para">4.) I agree that I will be obligated and responsible for a $100,000.00 penalty fee which I, agree
          to be assessed automatically against me in the event that I or my respective heirs, assigns, personal agents or

          document is given. I agree that the venue for any dispute that may arise out of this agreement to which Carolina
          Outfitters, Inc. or its agents is a party shall be in Bryson City, N.C. </p>
        <p class="para">5.) I agree that each item of the contract stands independently, and that if one item should be
          ruled against by a member of a legal court, all the others items will remain effective. </p>
